## 1.1 Overview of Fluid Power Systems

Fluid power systems form the backbone of modern industrial operations, transportation, and building management. These systems harness the properties of fluids to transmit power, control movement, and maintain optimal environments across diverse applications. Unlike traditional mechanical systems that rely on solid linkages, fluid power systems use liquids or gases to transmit force and energy efficiently over distances.

The main categories of fluid power systems include:

- **Hydraulic systems** - Using incompressible liquids (typically oil) to transmit force
- **Pneumatic systems** - Employing compressed air to generate mechanical motion
- **HVAC systems** - Managing air quality, temperature, and humidity in buildings
- **Vacuum systems** - Creating pressure differentials for material handling and processing
- **Cooling water systems** - Transferring heat away from equipment and processes
- **Dust collection systems** - Removing particulates from air for safety and quality control
- **Pumping systems** - Moving liquids through pipes for various applications
- **Fan systems** - Circulating air for ventilation, cooling, and process requirements
