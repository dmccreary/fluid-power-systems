# Advanced Fluid Power Systems: AI, Controls, and Sustainable Design

Welcome to the website for our course.

This course equips technicians with skills to install, maintain, and optimize fluid power systems (HVAC, vacuum, compressed air, cooling water, dust collection, hydraulics, pumping, and fans) while leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), advanced controls, data collection, and software tools. Students will learn to use AI-driven insights, real-time monitoring, and automation to maximize labor efficiency, system performance, and sustainability. Through hands-on labs, software simulations, and real-world scenarios, students will prepare for roles in smart, eco-conscious industries.
