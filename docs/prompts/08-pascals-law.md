    Please generate a MicroSim that demonstrates Pascal's Law.  
    Draw two vertical cylinders filled with a blue fluid and connected together at the bottom.  
    On the left is a small narrow cylinder, on the right a larger wider cylinder.  Allow the student to use a slider to change the pressure at the top of the left cylinder.  Show how that pressure transfers to a larger pressure but lower distance on the right cylinder.  Display the pressure and distance measurements on the diagram.
