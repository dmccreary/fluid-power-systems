# Concept Taxonomy

Given the list of concepts, your next task is to
organize these concepts into a taxonomy by grouping them into
appropriate categories. 

Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.

Suggest 10-12 categories for the taxonomy and assign each concept
to one or more categories. Ensure that the categories cover
a range of concept types, including abstract ideas, practical
applications, Python libraries, common misunderstandings, and real-world examples.
Avoid redundancy and ensure that each category is distinct.

Your first category is "Foundational Concepts", your second is "Terms and Definitions".   A final category might be "Final Goals".
