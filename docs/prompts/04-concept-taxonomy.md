# Concept Taxonomy

Given the list of concepts, your next task is to
organize these concepts into a ten classification taxonomy by grouping them into
appropriate categories. 

Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.

Suggest ten categories for the taxonomy and assign each concept
to one or more categories. Ensure that the categories cover
a range of concept types, including abstract ideas, practical
applications, Python libraries, common misunderstandings, and real-world examples.
Avoid redundancy and ensure that each category is distinct.

Your first category is "Foundational Concepts", your second is "Terms and Definitions".   A final category might be "Closing Topics".

## Response

I'll organize the concepts from the file into a ten-category taxonomy for the Advanced Fluid Power Systems course. Since I don't have access to the actual content of the CSV file (it appears to be empty in the document you provided), I'll create the taxonomy based on the course materials you shared.
