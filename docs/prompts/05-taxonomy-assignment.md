# Taxonomy Assignment

!!! prompt
    Our next step is to assign each concept a primary taxonomy classification.

    Please regenerate a new CSV file starting with the 03dependencies.csv file. 

    Please add a new extra column called TaxonomyID. Assign each Concept to a single Taxonomy classification.  

    Use the numbers for each category as the TaxonomyID.

    1.  Foundational Concepts
    2.  Terms and Definitions
    3.  System Components and Hardware
    4.  Control Systems and Automation
    5.  AI and Data Analysis
    6.  Application Systems
    7.  Maintenance and Troubleshooting
    8.  Efficiency and Sustainability
    9.  Safety and Compliance
    10.  Closing Topics

    The new CSV file has the following format:

    ConceptID (from 03dependencies.csv)

    ConceptLabel (from 03dependencies.csv)

    Dependency List (from 03dependencies.csv)

    TaxonomyID
