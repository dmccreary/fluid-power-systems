    Given everything that you know about this course from the project knowledge files, please generate a list of interactive computer simulations (MicroSim) that could be created with p5.js that would help student learn these concepts.  A MicroSim is a interactive simulation that runs within a browser were the parameters of the simulation are varied by user controls such as buttons and sliders.  These simulations often have controls such as "Start Sim" - "Pause/Continue" and "Stop".  They often have a digram on the left side, a time-series chart on the right side, and controls below the MicroSim drawing area.

    Use the following process to identify possible MicroSims.

    Figure out what concepts are the most challenging for students to visualize
    Figure out if these concepts could be explained by an interactive simulation.
    If you do identify a concept that could be explained by a MicroSim, give that simulation a clever name, a description and a list of the controls the student would change.
    For each MicroSim you identify, list some of the concepts that the student might learn after using the MicroSim.
