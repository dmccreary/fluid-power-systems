# Fluid Power Systems

This is an intelligent textbook about using AI to teach Fluid Power Systems.

This course equips technicians with skills to install, maintain, and optimize fluid power systems (HVAC, vacuum, compressed air, cooling water, dust collection, hydraulics, pumping, and fans) while leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), advanced controls, data collection, and software tools. Students will progress through all six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, developing cognitive skills from basic recall to complex creation of optimized systems. Through hands-on labs, software simulations, and real-world scenarios, students will prepare for roles in smart, eco-conscious industries.
